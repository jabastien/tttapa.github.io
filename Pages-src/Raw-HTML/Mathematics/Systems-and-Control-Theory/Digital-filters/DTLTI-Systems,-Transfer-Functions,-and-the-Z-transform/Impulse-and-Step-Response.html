<p>
    This page discusses two important signals that are often used in signal
    processing, the delta function or unit impulse, and the unit step function.
</p>

<h2>The Kronecker Delta Function</h2>

<p>
    The Kronecker delta function or unit impulse \(\delta[n]\) is defined as a
    discrete function that is one when \(n\) is zero, and zero everywhere else:

    $$ \begin{equation} 
    \delta: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}:
    n \mapsto \delta[n] \triangleq
    \begin{cases}
    1 &amp; n = 0 \\
    0 &amp; n\ne0
    \end{cases} 
    \label{kronecker-delta-function}
    \end{equation} $$

    An alternative notation is \(\delta_{n,k}\). This function is one if 
    \(n = k\) and zero if \(n \ne k\):
    $$ \delta_{n,k} \triangleq \delta[n-k] $$

<h3>Impulse response</h3>
<p>
    The impulse response \(h[n]\) of a DTLTI system \(T\) is defined as the
    output of the system when a Kronecker delta function is applied to its
    input:
    $$ h[n] \triangleq T\left(\delta[n]\right) $$
    The letter \(h\) will be used to refer to the impulse response of a system.
    As we'll see later, the impulse response can be used to fully define the
    system, it captures all of its properties.
</p>
<h3>Properties of the Kronecker Delta Function</h3>
<p>
    The most important property of the Kronecker delta is its ability to select
    a single term from an (infinite) sum:

    $$ \begin{split}
    &amp;\sum_{n=0}^\infty x[n]\cdot\delta[k-n]\\
    =\;&amp; x[0]\cdot\delta[k-0] + x[1]\cdot\delta[k-1]
    + \ldots + x[k]\cdot\delta[k-k] + \ldots \\
    =\;&amp; x[k]
    \end{split} $$
    As you can see, all terms where \(n \ne k\) are zero, so only the \(k\)-th
    term remains.<br>
    This is sometimes referred to as the <b>sifting property</b> of the delta 
    function.
</p>
<!--<p>
    Another property that shows up a lot in digital signal processing is the 
    expression as a sum of complex exponentials:
    $$ \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}
       \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{2\pi j k \frac{n}{N}} = \delta[n]$$
</p>-->

<h2>The Heaviside Step Function</h2>

<p>
    The (discrete) Heaviside step function or unit step function \(u[n]\)
    (sometimes \(H[n]\))
    is defined as a discrete function that is zero when \(n\) is negative, 
    and one if \(n\) is zero or positive:

    $$ \begin{equation}
    u: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}:
    n \mapsto u[n] \triangleq
    \begin{cases}
    0 &amp; n \lt 0 \\
    1 &amp; n \ge 0
    \end{cases} 
    \label{heaviside-step-function} 
    \end{equation} $$

<h3>Step Response</h3>
<p>
    Similar the impulse response, the step response is defined as the
    output of the system when the Heaviside step function is applied to the
    input:
    $$ y_\text{step}[n] \triangleq T\left(u[n]\right) $$
    The step response is an important tool when investigating how a system
    responds to transients.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike the impulse response, there is no universal symbol or letter for the
    step response.
</p>
<h3>Properties of the Heaviside Step Function</h3>
<p>
    The step function can also be written as the cumulative sum of the delta
    function:
    $$ u[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{n} \delta[k] $$
