<h3>Simplifying the Difference Equation</h3>

<p>
    Recall the Simple Moving Average difference equation:
    $$ \begin{equation} y[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x[n-i] \end{equation} $$
    A naive approach would be to implement the difference equation directly: keeping
    the last \(N-1\) inputs, and calculate the sum on each iteration, calculating
    \(N-1\) additions at each time step.<br>
    However, we can do much better if we notice how only two terms of the sum change
    each time:

    $$ \begin{split}
    y[n+1] &amp;= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x[n+1-i] \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{N} \left(x[n+1] + \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}x[n+1-i]\right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{N} \left(x[n+1] + \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}x[n+1-i] + x[n+1-N] - x[n+1-N]\right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{N} \left(x[n+1] + \sum_{i=1}^{N}x[n+1-i] - x[n+1-N]\right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{N} \left(x[n+1] + \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x[n-i] - x[n+1-N]\right) \\
    &amp;= y[n] + \frac{1}{N} \Big(x[n+1] - x[n+1-N]\Big) \\
    \end{split} $$

    We can now define the sum \(S[n]\) as follows:
    $$ \begin{split}
    S[n] &amp;\triangleq N\cdot y[n] \\
    &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x[n-i] \\
    \Leftrightarrow\; y[n] &amp;= S[n] / N
    \end{split} $$
    The difference equation then becomes:
    $$ \begin{equation} S[n+1] = S[n] + x[n+1] - x[n+1-N] \label{impl_diff} \end{equation} $$
    To update the sum, each iteration now requires only one addition and one
    subtraction, as well as some housekeeping to remember the previous inputs.
    To get the output \(y[n]\), a division by \(N\) is needed.
</p>

<h3>C++ Implementation</h3>

<p>
    We can now implement Equation \(\ref{impl_diff}\) directly, and we'll use a
    rounding division instead of truncating the quotient. Note that this rounding
    operation is valid for unsigned integer types only.<br>
    The previous inputs \(x[n-i]\) are kept in a circular buffer.

<h3>Arduino Example</h3> 

<p>
As a basic example, you can use this filter for smoothing analog inputs on 
microcontrollers. Keep in mind that an exponential moving average filter is 
often more appropriate than a simple moving average filter. 
The SMA uses much more memory, and is much slower than the EMA. 
The exponential impulse response of the EMA may be better as well.<br>
