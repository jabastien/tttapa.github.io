<p>
    This is a quick guide on how to get remote Python development working on a Raspberry Pi 3. It allows you to open
    Visual Studio Code on your computer, while opening a workspace folder on the Raspberry Pi over SSH. All files are
    saved on the Pi, the terminal is on the Pi, the Python extension runs on the Pi, etc. but you can use the editor as
    if you were doing local development.
</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi 3</h3>

<p>
    Install Ubuntu Server 18.04 or later and set it up to use over SSH as explained <a href="../Installation+Setup/Setting-up-Ubuntu.html">here</a>.
    It's important that you have the SSH configuration and that you're able to find the Pi on the network (using mDNS,
    DNS, or a fixed IP address).
</p>

<h3>Desktop</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.</li>
    <li>Install the "Remote - SSH" extension and reload the window if necessary (<code>CTR+Shift+P</code> &gt; Reload Window).</li>
    <li>Hit <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code>, type "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host..." and confirm with enter.</li>
    <li>Choose your Raspberry Pi 3 SSH configuration and hit enter again.</li>
    <li>The VS Code Server will now be installed to the Pi, this will take a moment.</li>
    <li>Once it's finished, open a terminal in VS Code. This is a terminal on the Pi.</li>
    <li>Create a workspace folder using <code>mkdir MyProject</code>, and open it in VS Code (<code>Ctrl+K+O</code>).</li>
    <li>Open the extensions panel using <code>Ctrl+Shift+X</code>, search for the Python extension by Microsoft, and
        install it.</li>
    <li>Clear the extension search field, and in the "Local - Installed" tab, click "Install in SSH: RPi3" next to the
        Python extension (green button).</li>
    <li>When it's done installing, it'll say "Reload Required" (blue button). Click it to reload the window with the
        extension enabled.</li>
    <li>In the bottom left corner, click "Select Python Interpreter" and select the Python version to use on the Pi.
    </li>
    <li>Create a new Python file, add <code>print('Hello, World!')</code>, and save it.</li>
    <li>Use <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code>, type "Python: Run Python File in Terminal" and hit enter to run the file. <br>
        This should print "Hello, world!" in the terminal.</li>
    <li>That's it, you can now write Python code in VS Code as usual, even though the files are saved and executed on
        the Pi.</li>
</ol>
